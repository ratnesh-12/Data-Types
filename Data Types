OUTPUT
Enter any integer: 111
Integer = 111 and size is 4 bytes
Enter any number with decimal: 11.12
Float = 11.12 and size is 4 bytes
Enter any word: hello
Srting = hello and size is 32 bytes
Enter any number with bigger decimal: 3.1415926
Double = 7.87263e-85 and size is 8 bytes
Enter any character: #
Character = # and size is 1 bytes
Enter True/False: True
Boolean = 0 and size is 1 bytes
